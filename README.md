We will analyze tweets from the microblogging platform Twitter to classify them as either 

positive or negative in sentiment, based on a specific person or topic. 

Our system will calculate and display the percentage of tweets for each sentiment category, along with highlighting the top tweets representing both viewpoints. 

Additionally, we will develop a Python-based program to stream live tweets related to the chosen person or hashtag.
